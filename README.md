# Monopoly

The final project I made for my intro to computer science class. Uses wxPython to create a GUI in python.
The game is almost fully functional. All the spaces are operational, rolling is random, and your pieces travel
around the board. The only feature that I didn't add was houses/hotels (making the game semi-unbeatable),
but if a player does end up running out of money, he will lose the game.
